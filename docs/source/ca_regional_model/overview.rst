Show plot

The construction of this model showcases many of the components of the eccoseas
package in the downscale and ecco modules.

The functions used in this demo include the tasks in the following list:

1. Bathymetry "filling" to remove isolated regions
2. Reading the ECCO grid
3. Reading ECCO Version 5 output fields
4. Reading ECCO external forcing fields
5. Interpolating 2D and 3D fields to a regional domain for both initial and boundary conditions
